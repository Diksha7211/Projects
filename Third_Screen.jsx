                            <h5>Any Realtor can put your home in the MLS and advertise it. No other Real Estate Company is fully licensed and knowledgeable in everything that comprises the sale of your home. Does your agent have experience underwriting loans? Do they understand how insurability options can affect the sale of your home especially in fire areas? Do they know the warning signs to look out for from the buyer’s lender? Can they explain the difference between qualification and approval? Do they know what TILA, LE, PTC, PTD, PTF are or how loan conditions work? Does your agent have any idea what an Escrow Officer really does behind the scenes? WE DO. Only Homevana is licensed and knowledgeable to advise and handle everything to do with real estate, lending, escrow, and insurance. Your Homevana Broker will handle EVERYTHING from listing through closing. We can even qualify buyer financing before you accept an offer to make sure so loan surprises in the middle of escrow!</h5>
                            <h3>What does this mean to you?</h3>
                            <h5>Homeowners who list with Homevana are hiring the most educated, licensed and experienced brokers possible. Homevana’s sellers have NEVER BEEN SUED and keep buyer deposits when other agents say it’s not possible. We put our clients before our commissions and our 5 Star reputation proves it. Before you hire that franchise agent who markets themselves – not your property – sit down with a Homevana Realtor and see the difference in person.</h5>
